BMI CALCULATOR
<p>A BMI (Body Mass Index) Calculator project using Python is a simple application designed to compute an individual's BMI based on their weight and height. The project typically involves creating a user interface where users can input their weight and height. The Python program then calculates the BMI using the formula:

BMI = weight(kg)/height(m)^2
â€‹
The result is categorized into different health ranges (e.g., underweight, normal weight, overweight, obesity) according to standard BMI categories. This project can be implemented using libraries such as Tkinter for a graphical user interface (GUI) and PIL for image processing if needed. It helps users easily monitor and understand their body weight status and encourages healthier lifestyle choices.</p>
